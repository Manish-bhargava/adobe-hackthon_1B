In such cases, carbide bur can be used to remove about 1 mm of the custom tray material from the crest of ridge area. CONCLUSION While making impression, one should apply pressure selectively only in certain areas, which can withstand the forces of mastication."

There are four basic impression theories that have been proposed and accepted over the years being: Mucostatic, Mucocompressive, Minimal Pressure, Selective Pressure Techniques. Other being Muco-Seal Techniue, Impression by the use of sub-atmospheric pressure, Impression for compromised patients, Impression technique for patients with severely resorbed mandibular ridges."

He suggests not to cover the posterior palatal Seal Area with the wax spacer so that the custom tray touches the mucosa directly and the additional stress placed here during impression making would create a posterior palatal seal. Also this part of the tray will act as a guiding stop to help position the tray properly during impression procedures."
