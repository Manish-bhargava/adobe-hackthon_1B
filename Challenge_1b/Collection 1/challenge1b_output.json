Deep learning uses automated  collective  learning  techniques,  as  opposed  to  traditional  machine  learning,  which  completes  classification tasks by a sequence of steps that include preprocessing, feature extraction, careful feature selection, and then learning and classification. This paradigm offers a more integrated and automated method for tasks of this kind because the system can  simultaneously  learn  and  classify  data."

Deep Learning Applied to Cloud Computing Security With the continued rapid development of cloud computing, there will inevitably be an increase in cyber-attacks targeting cloud data, which will raise the associated risks of managing and storing such data. Anil Kumar et al. presented a cloud- centric intrusion prevention strategy based on deep learning concepts to address this changing problem. Deep learning technology is the main tool used in this novel approach to categorize and gauge the efficacy of network intrusions."

Using a cloud service architecture, serverless computing breaks down large applications into functional blocks, with independent modules running as needed. Rich computational resources and  outstanding  performance  are  features  of  serverless  cloud  computing,  which  can  also  leverage  deep  learning  to improve efficiency."

The efficiency of data center infrastructure is low in the current cloud environment, and when an operation goes wrong, the throughput of data center facilities will be drastically reduced  to maintain the stability and quality of cloud connectivity, which will lower the quality of cloud computing services. To address the issue of slow cloud service speed, a deep reinforcement learning scheduling mechanism is therefore put forth in the literature [6]."
